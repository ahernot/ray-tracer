# Ray Tracer (v0.1)

Physics simulation ray-tracing algorithm

Assumptions:
* Ray path is frequency-independent (but rebounds aren't)

TODO:
- Clean up physics/
- Rename Simulation2D to Source2D, Simulation2D.add_rays to Source2D.cast_rays
- Simulation2D can be plotted and takes an env and multiple Source2D objects
